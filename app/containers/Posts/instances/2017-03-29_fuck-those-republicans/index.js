              If a website you are visiting has an SSL/TLS certificate, the data it passes back and forth between you and it can be encrypted.  Encryption is kinda just applied mathematics. The government, this time, is not trying to get at that encrypted information, but they have in the past. This feels like an indicator that they want to again. And I wouldn't put it past them if they didn't know that https protocol would still prevent information from being shared.'

                With services like Let's Encrypt, it is super easy to get a TLS/SSL certificate for your website these daysâ€”for free. If your site has one of these certificates, then the data it passes back and forth between you and it can be encrypted.It
