            I do like this setup of working on my laptop with VS Code open on the right and a browser on the left. Terminal down below. Console below the browser.

            Why does it take so much longer to refresh the browser on this machine compared to my PC? If I look at the timeline on my laptop, I see that the majority of the time was spent fetching React DLLs. Hmm.

            Here's some ideas for normatives.
            <li>Questions posed in the post. (regex question marks)</li>

            One thing this will enforce is only using dots to mark sentence breaks. Or maybe capitalization.

            It would be pretty cool to hook this whole thing up to its git repository. Fetch components from commit dates.
            I bet it would be easy to break things. Although it kind of always is.
