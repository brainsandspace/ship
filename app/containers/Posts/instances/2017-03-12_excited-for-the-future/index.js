        <h3>Who are we but me?</h3>

        <PostP>
          There's all these problems I'm running into and I know how to go about fixing them, I just haven't had the time. And I know I need to do them because they are slowing me down. I can feel them holding me back.
        </PostP>

        <PostP>
          For example, I need to implement some unit and integration testing. Right now this is what I see in my browser.
        </PostP>

        <img src={errorImage} alt="a red error" />

        <PostP>
          Like I can't even test if that error-image screenshot worked right now because of the error blocking my way.
        </PostP>

        <PostP>
          Just minutes ago I was brimming with ideas. And now I can remember none of them.
        </PostP>

        <h3>
          Do I want this kind of thing to be public? And if so, how public?
        </h3>

        <PostP>
          Okay and we're back. Maybe one way I could try to show what just happened would be a screen recording. So I could for example jump to a quick screen recording if I know something convoluted is going on.

        <PostP>
          Idea for jawn. Wire. Wearing a wire. Always. Only to record your own voice. And then be able to analyze your vocabulary, syntax, tonality, allâ€”the good stuff.

        <h2>Have I talked about <i>annotations</i> on here before?</h2>
        <PostP>I don't think that I have.</PostP>

        <PostP>
          There's basically this new spec that aims to bring a standardized annotation layer to the web. I'm pretty excited about it. I want to build my own to see what kind of challenges are going to arise.
        </PostP>

        Here's some thoughts I've had so far.
        <ul style={{ listStyle: 'disc', paddingLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li>
            Annotations should be tied to nodes.
          </li>

          <li>Tablet and stylus support for beauty.</li>

          <li>
            Graph data structure. Maybe. Yes probably definitely fo the social aspects.
          </li>

              It has been a while since I have reminisced about overhead projectors.

            Imagine you have all these different slides.
            <Thought>
              The difference between
              {' '}
              <i>gource</i>
              {' '}
              and
              {' '}
              <i>roz</i>
              {' '}
              is the scale. Gource tracks commits, not every time you touch a file in between commits.
