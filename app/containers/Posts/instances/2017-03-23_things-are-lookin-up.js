            I find myself often choosing to just do classic posts. I should really give myself the option for writing in Markdown.

            There are sooo many things a user should not have to do that I have to do right now when making a new blog post. I need to tighten that up.

            I feel like it's a really good time to be in the software tooling industry.

            You haven't the least idea how much time making that search bar took me. And it isn't done. But it's mostly done. Kinda. It isn't functional yet. Like it wont Google Things. You
            {' '}
            <i>can</i>
            {' '}
            type.

          <h3>Fuck actually this page is broken. Will fix in future.</h3>
