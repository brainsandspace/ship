# The Eve of the Dawn

I have afraid what I am about to describe is simply an operating system that is javascript based. But I think it could be something more. Or it might just be Chromium. 

The computer is the editor is the computer is alive.

Some features before they escape me
Time travelling style. That one is pretty self explanatory. If you know about the inception of Redux and web design in general. Correction: If you know about the inception of Redux, you definitely understand the meaning of styles and a stylesheet.

I guess the component tree also needs to be time traversible. If we are using styled-components though, styles will just be coupled to their components. Which would solve two birds with one stoner. What. What.



About conveying voice.

The main problem I was running into when I was doing those self-writing jawns was just that—I need to remember to not refer back to things that I thought but didn't write down. It is incomprehensible. 

I like words. 
I like typing.
I like science.
I like philosophy.
I like history. The idea of history more than historical details. So many people have been. Do you consider that a full sentence?

Communication for clarity.
Communication for communists.
Illumination of scientists.
Annebriation of nihilists.
Incineration violence.
Incendiary aisle chimps.

Rhymes are fun.



Quote on quote "show" idea. No talking. Completely screens. Conversations. Madness. 

Metarentional time loops ~~allowed~~ encouraged.

Completely unrelated: Going back over things a second time makes a world of difference in comprehension. And doing things yourself. For example, I should blog about that problem with Instagram compression around text.

This page is a good example of how I need to be branching thought trains more often. <-- The idea of a thought train is so 


~~Product/Program~~ Vision is something like Figma but components are codable also, in a very easy way. Am I just describing flash (currently Adobe Animate)? Yikes. No, because the editor evolves beside you and keeps its history. But we can't keep all of history, can we? The memory it could occupy! Yikes. I think my vision might have some memory problems—at least on the backend. Client would not have problems—could trash and fetch state updates.

Living breathing git live interfacial space machine.

The words sure are flowing right now lol.

When I reread something I wrote, I try to do it as if I had never seen it before and am trying to understand it as someone reading someone else's work it for the first time. Sometimes. Remember, I speak in exaggerational superlatives.

Oooh this will be good.

Duet with apple pencil. Figma with apple pencil. Pressure sensitive is a must. 
Figma with Codepen blogging tool. With Hemingway-esque analysis, but better. And 100% composible/extensible.

Nick Hall as lead marketer and spokesperson. HAI.

Should make multiple distinguishable large components/sub-apps that can be used together or standalone. For instance, one of them just analyzes your words. Maybe even all your words from forever. From all your typings. Or specific applications. The obvious answer is to allow for both, but there should be presets and defaults for people who just want to use its default functionalities.

Question about Codepen: Can I do live preview of Codepen blog with custom CSS showing? Why not? (What are the technical reasons that are holding you back from this kind of thing?)

Similar question for Figma.

## Names for tools
### Self-analysis tool
- Socrates
- Examiner
-
The unexamined life is not worth living. But what about the examined life? (Turns out not original, as expected.) TODO should link to the New york times article with similar title from 1994 about Prozac Nation.

**TODO functionality** This is really something I need to implement. For all the things really.
  - Idea: backround process always running key logger looking for you to type 'TODO' which triggers some kind of something. Perhaps just a log that lists the file you are editing and the context?
    - TODO get robotjs working on windows 10...oooor install Linux ubuntu desktop as dual boot option thing.


Look into HashiCorps as a possible model for building a multiple-app-centered open core corporation.
